Brace yourself for a framework that transcends the limitations of conventional analysis techniques. 💪🔍

Traditional approaches often rely on integral metrics like total duration, total distance, and average heart rate, but they fall victim to the dreaded "overall metrics problem." These metrics fail to capture the essence of sports activities, omitting crucial components and leading to potentially flawed and misleading conclusions. They lack the ability to recognize distinct stages and phases of the activity, such as the invigorating warm-up, the endurance-testing main event, and the heart-pounding intervals. ⏱️🚴‍♀️📈

Fortunately, our sport-activities-framework rises above these limitations, revealing a comprehensive panorama of your sports activity files. This framework combines the power of identification and extraction methods to unlock a treasure trove of valuable data. Picture this :camera: : effortlessly identifying the number of hills, extracting average altitudes of these remarkable formations, measuring the total distance conquered on those inclines, and even deriving climbing ratios for a true measure of accomplishment (total distance of hills vs. total distance). But that's just the tip of the iceberg! The framework seamlessly integrates a multitude of extensions, including historical weather parsing, statistical evaluations, and ex-post visualizations that bring your data to life. 🗻📊🌦️

For those seeking to venture further, we invite you to explore the realms of scientific papers on data mining that delve into these captivating topics.

## 🌦️ Historical weather data
Weather data parsed is collected from the [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/).
Please note that this is an external unaffiliated service, and users must register to use the API.
The service has a free tier (1000 Weather reports/day) but is otherwise operating on a pay-as-you-go model.
For pricing and terms of use, please read the [official documentation](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-data-editions) of the API provider.

## 🧩 Overpass API, Open Elevation API & OpenTopoData integration
Without performing activities, we can use the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) for the identification of hills,
total ascent, and descent. This is done using the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API)
which is a read-only API that allows querying of OSM map data. In addition to that altitude, data is retrieved by using the
[Open-Elevation API](https://open-elevation.com/) or [OpenTopoData API](https://www.opentopodata.org/)  which are open-source and free alternatives to the Google Elevation API.
Both of the solutions can be used by using free publicly acessible APIs ([Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API), [Open-Elevation](https://open-elevation.com/#public-api), [OpenTopoData](https://www.opentopodata.org/#public-api)) or can be self hosted on a server or as a Docker container ([Overpass](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Installation), [Open-Elevation](https://github.com/Jorl17/open-elevation/blob/master/docs/host-your-own.md), [OpenTopoData](https://www.opentopodata.org/server/)).

## 🚀 Examples

### Reading files

#### (*.TCX)
```python
from sport_activities_features.tcx_manipulation import TCXFile

# Class for reading TCX files
tcx_file=TCXFile()
data = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file") # Represents data as dictionary of lists

# Alternative choice
data = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file", numpy_array= True) # Represents data as dictionary of numpy.arrays

```

#### (*.GPX)
```python
from sport_activities_features.gpx_manipulation import GPXFile

# Class for reading GPX files
gpx_file=GPXFile()

# Read the file and generate a dictionary with 
data = gpx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file") # Represents data as dictionary of lists

# Alternative choice
data = gpx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file", numpy_array= True) # Represents data as dictionary of numpy.arrays

```

### Extraction of topographic features
```python
from sport_activities_features.hill_identification import HillIdentification
from sport_activities_features.tcx_manipulation import TCXFile
from sport_activities_features.topographic_features import TopographicFeatures
from sport_activities_features.plot_data import PlotData

# Read TCX file
tcx_file = TCXFile()
activity = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_file")

# Detect hills in data
Hill = HillIdentification(activity['altitudes'], 30)
Hill.identify_hills()
all_hills = Hill.return_hills()

# Extract features from data
Top = TopographicFeatures(all_hills)
num_hills = Top.num_of_hills()
avg_altitude = Top.avg_altitude_of_hills(activity['altitudes'])
avg_ascent = Top.avg_ascent_of_hills(activity['altitudes'])
distance_hills = Top.distance_of_hills(activity['positions'])
hills_share = Top.share_of_hills(distance_hills, activity['total_distance'])
```

### Extraction of intervals
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('../')

from sport_activities_features.interval_identification import IntervalIdentificationByPower, IntervalIdentificationByHeartrate
from sport_activities_features.tcx_manipulation import TCXFile

# Reading the TCX file
tcx_file = TCXFile()
activity = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_the_data")

# Identifying the intervals in the activity by power
Intervals = IntervalIdentificationByPower(activity["distances"], activity["timestamps"], activity["altitudes"], 70)
Intervals.identify_intervals()
all_intervals = Intervals.return_intervals()

# Identifying the intervals in the activity by heart rate
Intervals = IntervalIdentificationByHeartrate(activity["timestamps"], activity["altitudes"], activity["heartrates"])
Intervals.identify_intervals()
all_intervals = Intervals.return_intervals()
```

### Parsing of Historical weather data from an external service
```python
from sport_activities_features import WeatherIdentification
from sport_activities_features import TCXFile

# Read TCX file
tcx_file = TCXFile()
tcx_data = tcx_file.read_one_file("path_to_file")

visual_crossing_api_key = "weather_api_key" # https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api

# Explanation of elements - https://www.visualcrossing.com/resources/documentation/weather-data/weather-data-documentation/
weather = WeatherIdentification(tcx_data['positions'], tcx_data['timestamps'], visual_crossing_api_key)
weatherlist = weather.get_weather(time_delta=30)
tcx_weather = weather.get_average_weather_data(timestamps=tcx_data['timestamps'],weather=weatherlist)
# Add weather to TCX data
tcx_data.update({'weather':tcx_weather})
```
